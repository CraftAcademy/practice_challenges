- Explain the Single Responsibility Principle Pattern
It means that every class has only has one responsability over ONE part of functionality - nothing else.
And because of that it can be only one reason to change it. It is a part of object oriented programming,
as I understand it, and the principle exist so as to keep things as simple and easy to read as possible,
so programs are not totally confusing it their functionalities.


- Explain the DRY principle
DRY stands for Don´t Repeat Yourself and means that you should keep the code short and effective.
You should know what everything means and only use as much code as you need, not more , not less.
And don´t do three times what you only need to do once. It sounds simple, but it is not for a
beginner who often to a degree goes on trial and error.
