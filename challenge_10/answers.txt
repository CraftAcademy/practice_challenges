1) Explain the Single Responsibility Principle Pattern
- The single responsibility principle states that every module or class should
  have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the
  software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.
  - wikipedia
  I interpret this as: "Dont have a function/class/module doing more than one thing"

2) Explain the DRY principle
- Don't Repeat Yourself
  "every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous,
  authoritative representation within a system"
