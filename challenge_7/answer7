- Explain the concept of Acceptance - Unit test cycle
In the Acceptance - Unit test cycle you first describe how the user will interact with different parts of the application.
Then you build the functions required. I the Craft Academy Git book the author describes it is as working "outside-in to
implement features". It is used as a help to ensure that the application-creaters are building the right functions at the
right time.

- What tools would you use if working with AUC on a Sinatra application?
In a Sinatra application I would use rSpec, Cucumber and Capybara for tests.
