- Explain the concept of Acceptance - Unit test cycle

* You create user stories to describe what you want your site to do and why.
ex: As a "role" I want "goal" so that "desire"

* You run tests on your code before you deploy it to find flaws/bugs in your code early into development, so that you can easily fix it.

* You run Acceptance tests on your user stories, and Unit tests on your actual code.


- What tools would you use if working with AUC on a Sinatra application?

* Cucumber and Rspec, they are the only ones im familiar with.
