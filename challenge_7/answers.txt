1) Explain the concept of Acceptance - Unit test cycle
-   You have an idea, formulate it as user-stories with stakeholders, business-
    value and features. These stories become your cucumber test (acceptance tests)
    which you run until you can't test more at that moment. Then it's time for
    Rspec and Unit tests, when they pass you move back to cucumber and so it goes on.

2) - What tools would you use if working with AUC on a Sinatra application?
    I understand this as AUC = authenticated user content
    gem 'bcrypt-ruby', '3.0.1'
    gem 'sinatra_warden'

    gem 'data_mapper'
    gem 'pg'
    gem 'dm-postgres-adapter'

    I would include the above gems. Top ones for password and authentication.
    Bottom ones for databases and database-constructing/accessing
