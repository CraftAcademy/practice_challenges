- Explain the Three Tier architecture
This principle is a little abstract to me, but basically it means that this type of
architechure has many "tier:s" that they keep seperate from eachother, preferably on
different platsforms,so that for instance the presentation-part is physically separated
from the data managing part and the applications processin part.

- Explain the MVC pattern
The Model-View-Controller pattern is something we have talked a lot about during this course.
Like the Three Tier-model above it keeps its parts seperated from eachother. MVC stands for:
Model (the information that the application processes and the how it changes if it can change)
View (what the user can see)
Controller (that interacts with the view, the users response if there are any, and the Model)
