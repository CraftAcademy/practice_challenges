1) Explain the Three Tier architecture
- Data, Logic, Presentation
  Data is databases, server-side information,
  Logic is where the calculations are made and information gets presented in
  Presentation. This is what we can see.

2) Explain the MVC pattern
- Model View Controller (MVC) is an architectural software design pattern
  for implementing user interfaces. The MVC pattern takes care of the
  request made by the web- and application server and by the application
  itself. An appropotiate response is then sent back to the client.

  So:
  In complex applications it can be a good idea to separate data (model) and
  presetation (view) so that changes in the presentation wont mess up the
  data-processing. Plus it makes it possible to reorganize the data without
  any changes in presentation-tier. The MVC solves this by separating data from
  presentation and ui - via the controller.
