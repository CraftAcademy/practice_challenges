1) Explain the Three Tier architecture
- Data, Logic, Presentation
  Data is databases, server-side information,
  Logic is where the calculations are made and information gets presented in
  Presentation. This is what we can see.

- Model View Controller (MVC) is an architectural software design pattern
  for implementing user interfaces. The MVC pattern takes care of the
  request made by the web- and application server and by the application 
  itself. An appropotiate response is then sent back to the client.
